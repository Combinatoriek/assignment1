\begin{enumerate}[a]
	\item %a
	Every $7^{th}$ number is divisible by 7. There are $999 - 100 = 899$ numbers in the range $[100, 999]$. This means that there are $\lfloor 899 / 7 \rfloor = 128$ numbers divisible by 7 in this range.
	\setcounter{enumi}{3} \item %d
	$\dfrac{3}{4}$ of all natural numbers are not divisible by 4. There are $\lceil \dfrac{3 * 899}{4} \rceil = 675$ numbers in the range $[100, 899]$ which are not divisible by 4.
	\setcounter{enumi}{6} \item %g
	Every $3^{rd}$ number is divisible by 3. There are $\lfloor 899 / 3 \rfloor = 299$ numbers divisible by 3 in the range $[100, 899]$.

	Since we do not want to count the numbers divisible by 4 as well, we subtract the numbers which are divisible by $lcm(3, 4) = 12$. There are $\lfloor 899 / 12 \rfloor = 74$ numbers divisible by 12 in the range $[100, 899]$.

	The final answer are all numbers divisible by 3, without the numbers divisible by 4 as well: $299 - 74 = 225$.
